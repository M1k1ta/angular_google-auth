** for back-end(BD and deploing service) used free serveces(Neon and render.com), so first loading datas will be realy long, and maybe need to realoding

Hello. This project I create after getting one test task. The task was to create Google auth and after auth user could invite a friend. Other things I come up with alone. I was creating this app for about 10 days. Two work weeks. Maybe It took a lot of time. But I learned Angular and Google auth when I created this task. So I think It was good practice for me. I created Front-end and Beck-end alone. 

I started from Google auth. I learn a lot of documentation, and did Google auth after some time. It is a small thing, but I found a lot of old information on the internet. Which weist my time. Also, I decided to create standard auth with email and password. Because without it auth seems very small. I don't want to create a white display with one button Google auth. So I add a lot of things in time developing.

So, auth I styled without angular function. I know that angular has methods that help create easy forms. But I don't look for an easy way, and at that time I don't want to spend my time on easy things now. I can learn it later. Also, I created the back-end to auth. I worked with Node, Express, and Sequlize before. So I don't have a problem with it. 

After auth, I learned routing in Angular. With Angular docs and chat GPT I understood how to block content in time login or registration. After I started creating content. At the same time, I thought about how will be looking my app. So in this task, I also was how designer. If you use Telegram you can understand that I looked on this app when creating my project.

In this part, I want to boast of the back end. Before the front-end part also I did the back-end, and for me it was interesting. I try to do so methods that the user can see only so rooms with this user there are. Also, I created a bridge table. It is a table need to do a bridge between user data and room data. And this method I used in the first time and it was interesting for me. I remember that when I created the back end I was really glad!

About things that users can do in my project. 
Users can register google auth/form auth and log in the same. The user will be in the room Welcome when creating an account. Also, users can create rooms, and add friends to rooms using email. When the user adds a friend, the friend adds to the room and sends a message with-link to the email. If the user who gets invited to the room doesn't register in my project this user adds to data this room. But don't show this user if this user doesn't register.
